            <h1> Hello! </h1>

            <p> I'm Ishika, a self-taught product designer, who loves to solve problems and design experiences that are intuitive and accessible. Currently, I'm a sophmore at Cornell, studying Information Science with a concentration in User Experience, along with a minor in Business. I am a Milstein Scholar and Director of Alumni Relations for Women in Computing at Cornell. </p>

            <p> Since high school, I've been passionate about social change and have tried to make a difference in the community, whether it be by performing and organizing concerts for senior citizens or writing about social issues. This summer, I discovered the intersection of technology and social impact through my Google Classroom Case Study - design. And I fell in love with it. Since then, I've been challenging myself to learn more and more by designing across platforms including the web, mobile devices, and virtual reality and for non-profit organizations as a product designer for Hack4Impact. </p>

            <p> I'm always excited for new opportunities to grow as a designer and collaborate with others to create beautiful digital experiences. Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me at ia83@cornell.edu </p>
